# DesignPR

Primer design is critical to PCR, site-directed mutategenesis, and gene synthesis accuracy and efficiency. It is fundemental to protein engineering. Primers consist of short nucleotide sequences that bind to a DNA template, enabling fragment amplification, small insertions and deletions, and point mutations. The process of primer design takes into consideration many factors such as primer lengths, GC content, and annealing temperatures. There additional components to the primer design for using specific cloning methods. 

In vivo Assembly (IVA) is a cloning method that takes advantage of the host cells' own machinary to fuse DNA fragments together and circularize PCR products into plasmids. This is achieved through optimizing primer design to include both template-annealing and fragment-overlap regions that guide the assembly of DNA fragments in vivo. 

DesignPR is a user-friendly application for primer design with parameter optimization, enabling high-throughput primer generation and optimization for methods like IVA.
